  <h1>WebIWG markdown format</h1>

  <textarea id="in">A web page containing JavaScript will typically be fully accessible if the
functionality of the script is device independent (does not require only a mouse
or only a keyboard) and the information (content) is available to assistive
technologies. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix that can be applied to solve
all accessibility problems associated with JavaScript. The only way to ensure
JavaScript accessibility is by evaluating each pages that utilizes scripting and
devising a unique solution to any accessibility problem found.

We jointly published a number of articles on our web-site that often became
go-to references then, and it seems a shame that they be lost to the vagaries of
time; the original site long since gone. I have created an Archive section of
this site to preserve those postings, and the following article from that time
is one such. Please note that some of the information in this or other similar
articles may be dated, or superseded by events in time: I am making no attempt
to update these articles and am simply posting them as they existed when they
were first written.
